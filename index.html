    <h1>Michael T Bolla Elevator Project</h1>
    <p>
        To Get a C, you need to:
        Find an Elevator: TTU MCOM Building
        
        Take Photoes of the control interface: Done
        
        Show gif image of the control interface in operation: Done
        
        Find issues with Current Design: Buttons are not visually pleasing, buttons are scattered in places. Doesnt look Simple.
        The current design when showing floors is not clear it looks like the elevator is going up and down at the same time,
        also the all the numbers arnt clear as well. The background of the numbers is not clear on the feedback moving up and
        down floors. 
        
        Explain why it is good/bad: The GOOD, the buttons give feedback with a glowing red circle, the buttons also have braille.
        The BAD, the braille isnt effective to far from buttons in my opinion, the design is not visually pleasing for example
        one column is B, 3, 6, 9, 12. In my opinion it should just be 1, 2 ,3 ,4 and start a new column. The feedback on the floors
        moving is bad the arrow looks like its going both up and down, and the numbers background on the display isnt totally clear
        you can see multiple of numbers behind the original number. It should be clearer. </p>
